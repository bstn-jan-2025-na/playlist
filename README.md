# Instructions - Collaborative Git/Playlist!

## Description

This will be a musical playlist that will grow over time. This is meant to be a fun (and optional) collaborative project that we can all contribute to together. As we move along together, we can propose changes for any changes or edits to make. To start, this will exist as a markdown file (`playlist.md`), but that can change.

## Setup

- In your preferred destination on your computer, run

```
git clone https://github.com/bstn-jan-2025-na/playlist.git
```

(This will give you access to this project and the ability to push and pull new changes.)

## Sprint 1

1. clone the repo
2. Add 3-4 songs to the `playlist.md`
3. `add, commit, push`

## Sprint 2

Now that we have the songs in a markdown file, let's move to HTML!

1. In your `main` branch (the only branch you should have), make sure to run `git pull` to ensure you have everyone else's additions.
2. Create your own local branch named `firstname-lastname-develop`. (Make sure you are working inside of this branch!)
3. Add your songs to the ordered list and push your changes.
